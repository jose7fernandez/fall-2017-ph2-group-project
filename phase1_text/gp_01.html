        <h2>Acadia National Park</h2>
        
        <p>America's national parks are one of its best treasures containing some of the nation's most stunning landscapes.  There are  59 protected areas in the United States known as national parks.  It takes an act of the United States Congress for an area to be designated a national park.  In 1872, the Yellowstone National Park was established becoming the first national park in the country.  The National Park Service is in charge of operating the national parks.  The Organic Act of 1916 formed the agency "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations".</p>
        
        <p>Covering an area of 49,052 acres, Maine's Acadia National Park takes up 30,300 acres on Mount Desert Island in addition to 2,728 acres on Isle Au Haut, 2,366 acres on Schoodic Peninsula and parts of Baker Island.  Breathtaking in its natural beauty, the park features mountains with granite peaks, an ocean shoreline, woodlands and lakes.  The tallest mountain on the Atlantic coast of the United States, Cadillac Mountain, stands inside Acadia National Park.</p>
        
        <p>Acadia National Park has gone through two name changes since its creation.  In 1916, it was created under the name Sieur de Monts National Monument.  Three years later its name was changed to Lafayette National Park and since 1929 the park has been known as Acadia National Park.
